# music lyrics tagger

Tested on Windows 10 & Linux.

## Install

Create config in `~/.config/music-lyrics-tagger/config.yaml`:

```yaml
GENIUS_TOKEN: xxxxx
LYRICS_PROVIDER: genius # `azlyrics` or `genius`
```

And install with:

```bash
make install
```

## Notes

I did not add support for mp3 files, since I mainly use flac and m4a.
